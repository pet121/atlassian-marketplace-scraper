# Atlassian Marketplace Credentials
# Get API token from: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
#
# SIMPLE MODE (Single Account):
# Set credentials directly in .env file (not recommended for production)
MARKETPLACE_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
MARKETPLACE_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
#
# ADVANCED MODE (Multiple Accounts - Recommended):
# For multiple accounts with encryption and automatic rotation:
# 1. Leave the above credentials empty or remove them
# 2. Create/edit .credentials.json file (see documentation)
# 3. The system will automatically use encrypted credentials from .credentials.json
#
# Fallback behavior:
# - If .credentials.json exists and has credentials, use those (encrypted, supports multiple accounts)
# - If .credentials.json is empty/missing, fallback to .env credentials above (single account)
