feat: Enhanced task management with cancellation, filtering, and real-time log monitoring

## New Features

### Task Management UI Enhancements
- Added task cancellation functionality with Cancel button for running tasks
- Implemented task status filtering with tabs (All, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- Added "Clear Completed" button to remove finished/failed/cancelled tasks from view
- Real-time log monitoring: Last Log Line column showing latest log entry for each task
- Auto-refresh of task status and logs every 5 seconds
- Last update timestamp display for monitoring refresh activity

### Backend Improvements
- TaskManager now stores process objects for proper cancellation support
- Added cancel_task() method with graceful termination (SIGTERM) and force kill fallback
- Implemented clear_completed_tasks() to remove old task records
- Added get_task_log_file() to map scripts to their log files
- New API endpoint: POST /api/tasks/<task_id>/cancel
- New API endpoint: POST /api/tasks/clear-completed
- New API endpoint: GET /api/tasks/<task_id>/last-log

### UI/UX Improvements
- Tabbed interface for better task organization by status
- Scroll position preservation during task status updates
- Improved log display with monospace font and tooltip for full log line
- Better visual feedback with status badges and progress indicators
- Responsive table layout with proper text overflow handling

## Technical Details

### Task Cancellation
- Uses process.terminate() for graceful shutdown
- Falls back to process.kill() if termination fails
- Supports both Windows (SIGTERM) and Unix-like systems
- Updates task status to 'cancelled' with proper cleanup

### Log Monitoring
- Maps script names to log files:
  - run_scraper.py → scraper.log
  - run_version_scraper.py → scraper.log
  - run_downloader.py → download.log
  - run_description_downloader.py → description_downloader.log
- Reads last line from log file with timestamp extraction
- Caches log lines in JavaScript for performance
- Updates logs every 5 seconds for running tasks only

### Code Changes
- utils/task_manager.py: Added processes storage, cancel_task(), clear_completed_tasks(), get_task_log_file()
- web/routes.py: Added three new API endpoints for task management
- web/templates/manage.html: Complete UI overhaul with tabs, log column, and cancellation support

## Breaking Changes
None

## Migration Notes
No migration required. Existing tasks will continue to work with new features.
